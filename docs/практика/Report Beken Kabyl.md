Internship Report (Week 4)
Introduction
Internship base: Frontend development of the ExtraSpace application using React.js. This is a web application for managing storage spaces, allowing users to rent and manage their storage units. The goal of the 4th week of the internship was to enhance frontend development skills, integrate with backend APIs, and improve user experience.

- Developed a sidebar for navigation between dashboard sections
- Created components to display and edit user information

Week 3. Backend API Integration
- Configured an Axios client to interact with the API using the base URL https://extraspace-backend.onrender.com
- Implemented interceptors for automatic token insertion and error handling
- Set up CORS and cookie transmission for cross-domain requests
- Created a Vite proxy to bypass CORS issues during local development

Week 4. Improvement of Project Architecture
- Applied Feature-Sliced Design to organize the project structure
- Configured Zustand for managing authentication state with persistence in sessionStorage
- Created an AuthContext to provide authentication data throughout the app

- React Hook Form 7.56.2 with Zod 3.24.3 – for form handling and validation
- Axios 1.8.4 – for HTTP requests to the backend API
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 and Shadcn/UI (with Radix UI components) – for interface styling
- React Toastify 11.0.5 – for toast notifications
- js-cookie 3.0.5 – for browser cookie management
________________________________________
Results:
- Fully functional authentication module created with login, registration, and email verification
- User dashboard implemented with intuitive navigation and various sections
- Full backend API integration using a customized Axios client
- Feature-Sliced Design architecture implemented with clear layer separation
- Protected routes added with authorization check and redirection logic

- Implemented light/dark theme using CSS variables
- Created animated transitions between pages
- Designed user-friendly forms with validation and feedback
- Implemented notification system for success, error, and warning messages
________________________________________
Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Cross-domain authentication issues with the backend API
Solution: Configured CORS and enabled cookie transfer by setting withCredentials: true in Axios and added the token to the Authorization header. Also, set up a proxy in Vite:

 
Challenge: Managing authentication state across different components
Solution: Created an AuthContext using useContext, and built a Zustand store with session persistence:

 
Challenge: Displaying user-friendly error messages from the API
Solution: Used Axios interceptors for centralized error handling:

 
Challenge: Route protection from unauthorized access
Solution: Created a ProtectedRoute component:

 
Challenge: Optimizing performance with many components
Solution: Used lazy loading with React.lazy() and Suspense:

Final Conclusion
The fourth week of the internship significantly advanced the frontend development of the ExtraSpace application. The experience gained with modern React tools and architectural patterns such as Feature-Sliced Design proved extremely valuable.

Thanks to tools like React Hook Form and Zod, a robust form system was implemented, improving usability. Integration with the backend via Axios and React Query ensured efficient client-server interaction.

The application of Feature-Sliced Design resulted in clear code separation and better scalability. This architectural approach will be beneficial for future project growth.

Overall, the internship provided practical experience with modern frontend technologies, API communication, and the creation of complex user interfaces.
